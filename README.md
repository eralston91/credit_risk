# credit_risk

# Overview

This project was undertaken in order to attempt to apply machine learning to credit risk in order to evaluate models with unbalanced classes. In order to do this we used credit card data from LendingClub and applied both oversampling as well as undersampling to the data in order to determine if any of these models can be used to attempt to predict credit risk
